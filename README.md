Main idea - 
Each note has its color. It acts like note tag - it simply group notes by colors.
We can search by color (colors are predefined, and can be configured throw settings)

When we create note we can set color, title, descr and enable alarm clock to be fired when setted time will appear

Search is by date (start/end), by text (descr/title), color

RateActivity goes to Google Play only if mark is >= 4
if less, we just say "Thank you for your rating"
